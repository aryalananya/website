    Momo are traditional Nepalese dumplings filled with minced meat (often buffalo, chicken, or pork) or vegetables, seasoned with fresh herbs and spices, and served steamed or fried with a savory tomato-based dipping sauce called achar. Originating from Tibet, they are a staple in Nepal and the Himalayas, commonly featuring round or half-moon shapes.
